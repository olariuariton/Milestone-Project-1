        <h2>Club Objectives</h2>
        <p>
          The Club's goal is to create an educational project with innovative and interactive features and teaching
          methods that start with sports as a creative game.

          Football training for initiation / performance groups is carried out using exercises specific to initiation /
          performance, so that children can learn the secrets of football as well as possible.

          Depending on each stage of the child's development, age and physical abilities, motor skills, reflexes are
          formed, coordination is improved, effort is increased, football-specific technique and tactics are perfected,
          which ensures good adaptability to game situations.

          Disproported scores from children's matches</h3>
        <p>
          If you watch the results from the championships, tournaments or friendly matches for children, you will quite
          often notice final results with very large score differences (12-0, 16-1, even 25-0). These results can shake
          the confidence of any child. from that game and the disadvantaged team can suffer psychologically.
          Sometimes, the teams that win at huge differences in score are the ones that focus on the development of the
          collective game and not on the individual development of the little football players. But this is not always
          the case.

        <h3>Individual football trainings or not</h3>
        <p>
          All parents want their little footballers to be as good as possible and to progress as much as possible. When
          the parent wants the little one to be better at math, he puts a math meditator on it. The same thinking
          appeared in children's football, the individual training having the role of meditations in the education
          system. For most, individual training means football training conducted individually (player + coach) in order
          to accelerate the development of football.
          For the reasons explained above, we are not fans of individual training for field players. But we believe that
          individualization (ie working on the specific problems of each player) should not be missing from the training
          sessions. During the trainings of the FC BT-KIDS football school, children can be organized in workshops so
          that each workshop addresses the specific problems of that group of players. Thus the exercises can be
          performed in conditions of real adversity, they being performed in groups of players.
